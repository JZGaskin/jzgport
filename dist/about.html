            Hello, I'm JZ Gaskin. I am many things and all of them are pretty
            tech-nerdy. I've found that I enjoy working on complicated projects
            that also can become useful tools. I've had a career as a scientist
            and now I'm looking to do something creative that I enjoy.
            Personally, my motto is "better every day". I try to take that
            philosophy with me in everything I do.

            and dumps them out to a Microsoft Word file. I also developed the
            company's e-commerce website. This was the main sales channel for
            several years.
